# Privy Wallet Integration Setup

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Created `.env` file with proper configuration
2. **Incorrect PrivyProvider Config**: Updated to use proper Solana chain configuration
3. **Wallet Address Handling**: Fixed PublicKey conversion with error handling
4. **Authentication Methods**: Added support for multiple login methods

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get a Real Privy App ID

The current setup uses a placeholder App ID. To get a real one:

1. Go to [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
2. Create a new app
3. Configure it for Solana
4. Copy your App ID
5. Replace `clt1234567890abcdef` in `.env` with your real App ID

### 2. Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should contain:
```
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_real_privy_app_id_here
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
```

### 3. Privy Dashboard Configuration

In your Privy dashboard, make sure to:
- Enable Solana as a supported chain
- Set the RPC URL to `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
- Enable the login methods you want (email, Google, Discord, Twitter)
- Configure embedded wallets

## What Was Fixed

### Main Configuration (`src/main.tsx`)
- Added proper Solana chain configuration
- Enabled embedded wallet creation
- Added support for multiple authentication methods
- Configured proper RPC URLs

### Wallet Hook (`src/hooks/usePrivyWallet.tsx`)
- Fixed wallet address handling
- Added error handling for PublicKey conversion
- Improved debug logging
- Added access token support

### Wallet Selector (`src/components/WalletSelector.tsx`)
- Made authentication async
- Improved error handling

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Try different authentication methods
4. Check browser console for debug logs
5. Verify wallet connection and balance display

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for Privy-related errors
2. **Verify App ID**: Make sure you're using a real Privy App ID
3. **Network Issues**: Ensure you can reach the Solana devnet RPC
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Try in a different browser or incognito mode

## Next Steps

Once you have a real Privy App ID:
1. Replace the placeholder in `.env`
2. Test the wallet connection
3. Verify balance fetching works
4. Test transaction sending if needed
